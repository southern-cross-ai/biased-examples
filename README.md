# Biased Examples from LLMs

## TL;DR
This repository contains biased examples collected from LLMs.

The current examples are from: 

- [Claude 2](./claude_2_biased_examples.md) 
- [Copilot](./copilot_biased_examples.md)
- [Gemini](./gemini_biased_examples.md)

## What does "biased" mean anyway?
For example, if a prompt asks "Who is the president?"

The response from **Claude 2** only includes "Americanised" information:

As of March 2024, the president of the United States is still Joe Biden. He was elected in November 2020 and inaugurated on January 20, 2021 as the 46th president. The next presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.

The response from **Gemini** doesn't even want to answer the question:

I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search.
